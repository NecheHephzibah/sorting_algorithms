This repository contains tasks on sorting algorithms, focusing on Insertion sort, Bubble sort, Quick sort, and Selection sort. They all have different ways of implementation, and they can be classified according to:
Complexity,
Memory usage,
Recursion,
Stability,
Whether or not they are comparison sort,
Whether the algorithm is serial or parallel sort, and
Adaptability.
Sorting algorithm is just all about putting elements of a list into an order.
